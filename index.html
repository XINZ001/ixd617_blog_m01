                <p>The mystery woman on the cover of Duran Duran’s Rio became one of the era’s defining pop images. “The Mona Lisa of the Eighties,” Duran Duran’s Nick Rhodes calls her. They commissioned artist Patrick Nagel, who sent them a massive five-by-five canvas painting of their New Romantic muse, with her confident, all-knowing smile. “There she was,” John Taylor recalled. “The girl who was dancing on the sand.” It was a bold move in 1982 for a rock band to put a smiling woman on the cover, but as Rhodes said, “We all looked at it and smiled back at the girl.” </p>

                <h3>The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan</h3>
                <p><span>Bob Dylan</span></p>
                <p>If the entire Greenwich Village folk scene of the early Sixties had to be defined by a single image, it would unquestionably be the cover of The Freehweelin’ Bob Dylan. Shot by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein, it shows Dylan and girlfriend Suze Rotolo walking down Jones Street between Bleecker Street and West 4th Street on a frigid February day. “I felt like an Italian sausage,” Rotolo said in 2008. “Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” To everyone else, it was a tiny glimpse into a world of youth, freedom, and boundless creativity. When the Coen brothers created 2013’s Inside Llewyn Davis, which took place in New York during the folk revival, they drew heavily from it. </p>
